# 🖼️ Image Processing and Manipulation with OpenCV and Matplotlib

This project demonstrates a variety of **image processing techniques** using Python libraries like **OpenCV**, **Matplotlib**, and **NumPy**. It includes operations such as image resizing, color transformations, filtering, edge detection, and brightness adjustments. Additionally, it showcases creative manipulations like swapping features between images.


## 🧰 Introduction
This project explores fundamental and advanced techniques in image processing, enabling you to:
- Manipulate images pixel-by-pixel.
- Enhance image quality using brightness adjustments and histogram equalization.
- Apply filters for smoothing, sharpening, and edge detection.
- Experiment with creative transformations, such as swapping features between images.

## ✅ Prerequisites
Ensure the following libraries are installed:
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (`pip install opencv-python`)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (`pip install matplotlib`)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (`pip install numpy`)

### Files Required
- `cat.png`: An image of a cat.
- `horse.png`: An image of a horse.

## ✨ Features

### 1️⃣ Basic Image Operations
- **Color Space Conversion**  
  🔄 Convert images between BGR and RGB or grayscale formats.
- **Resizing**  
  🔍 Resize images to different dimensions.

### 2️⃣ Geometric Shape Drawing
- Add **lines**, **rectangles**, and **circles** to images for annotations.

### 3️⃣ Brightness and Contrast Adjustments
- 🌞 **Increase Brightness**: Modify pixel values to brighten an image.
- 🌙 **Decrease Brightness (Contrast)**: Reduce pixel values to darken an image.

### 4️⃣ Histogram Equalization
- 📊 Enhance grayscale images for better contrast using histogram equalization.

### 5️⃣ Filtering
- **Blurring**  
  🔵 Smooth images using:
  - Average Filter (Manual and Library-based)
  - Gaussian Blur (Manual and Library-based)
- **Sharpening**  
  🟧 Apply sharpening filters for edge enhancement.

### 6️⃣ Edge Detection
- Detect **vertical** and **horizontal edges** using kernel convolution.

### 7️⃣ Feature Swapping
- 🐶🐴 Swap features between two images:
  - Replace the cat’s face with a horse’s head.
  - Replace the horse’s head with the cat’s face.
